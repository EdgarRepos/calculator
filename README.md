# calculator

Basic calculator

This calculator was made with ReactJS and Redux.

It's functionality is pretty similar to the one that the windows calculator app has, just way more basic. One of the big differences
beetwen those two its that the one that i made doesn't show the previews value on the display.

The memory works in a similar way to the one on windows
-  With the M+ you save the value on the memory as it is
-  With the M- you save value on the memory but with a different symbol (for example if it was originally positive it will be negative)
-  The MR puts the value saved on the memory on the current value.

The calculator though it works i wasn't really able to finish it as i wanted to, it would be like the Alpha product.

It lacks styles, a better functionality, the repository is disordered, and it also lacks tests.
